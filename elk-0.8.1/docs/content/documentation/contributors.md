You want to contribute to the _Eclipse Layout Kernel_? Excellent! Here's what you need to do:

1. [Setting Everything Up]({{< relref "documentation/contributors/developmentsetup.md" >}}): Get necessary accounts and prepare everything for us to be able to accept your contributions.

1. [Development Workflow]({{< relref "documentation/contributors/developmentworkflow.md" >}}): Understand how development works at the _ELK_ project and how to get your code submitted.
