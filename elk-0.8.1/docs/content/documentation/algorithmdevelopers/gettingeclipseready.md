Developing layout algorithms requires you to have the _Eclipse Layout Kernel SDK_ installed in your Eclipse installation. Follow these steps to install it:

1. Start Eclipse and select _Help - Install New Software..._ from the menu.
1. In the _Work with:_ field, enter the address of our release or nightly update site, which you can find in our Downloads section.
1. From the _Eclipse Layout Kernel_ category, check _Eclipse Layout Kernel (Incubation) - SDK_ as well as _Eclipse Layout Kernel (Incubation) - SDK (sources)_ and click _Next_.
1. Follow the instructions of the installation wizard, accepting all of the license agreements.
1. Restart Eclipse.

After the restart, there won't seem to be much of a difference. Because there isn't. But rest assured that your development environment is now perfectly prepared for what is about to come.
