Before you can start development, follow this list of steps. Not doing so may result in us having to reject your contributions, which would make everyone sad.

1. **Register with GitHub**

    Chances are that you already have a GitHub account. If you don't, go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click _Sign up_ in the upper right corner.

1. **Register with Eclipse**

    You need an account at [Eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/). Create one by going to that site and clicking _Create account_ in the upper right corner of the site.

1. **Link Eclipse and GitHub**

    Once your account is set up, select _Edit my account_ in the upper right corner of [Eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/). On the _My Account_ page, select the _Account Settings_ tab, enter the name of your GitHub account in the _GitHub ID_ field and click _Update Account_ (you may have to provide more info for the site to accept the update). This will allow us to recognize your GitHub account as belonging to an Eclipse developer.

1. **"Sign" the Eclipse ECA**

    While still on the _My Account_ page, go to the _Eclipse ECA_ tab and follow the instructions to "sign" the _Eclipse Contributor Agreement_. This is a necessary piece of legal paperwork that basically says that you as a contributor certify that the code you contribute is actually yours to contribute and will be made available under an open source license.

1. **Sign Up to Our Development Mailing List**

    It would probably be a good idea to sign up for [developer mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/elk-dev). This ensures that you are up to date on current developments, and that you can get in touch with us easily. Just say hello!
