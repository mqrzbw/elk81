## Details

Besides the usual bunch of bug fixes, this release adds a number of neat enhancements and feature requests, among them the following:

* A complete re-implementation of how ELK Layered routes self loops which should fix all of the problems we saw in release 0.5.0.
* A rectangle packing algorithm which tries to place rectangles efficiently.
* A number of features geared at layout algorithm developers, such as:
    * A plug-in project template which initializes layout algorithm projects.
    * A new logging framework and views to debug layout algorithms.
    * A proper unit testing framework for layout algorithms.

Some changes may cause clients to break and may change layout results.
